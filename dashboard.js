/**
 * Trivial UDP-based "dashboard server" written in node.js, using
 * redis for storage.
 *
 * Remote clients will send UDP-packets to :4433, they will then be
 * prepended with the source IP, the date, and then stored in a redis
 * list.
 *
 * Each entry may later be retrieved, in order of submission, and then
 * displayed to present a simple dashboard.
 *
 * NOTE: The list is capped at 1000 entries, and this cap is applied
 *       at submission-time.
