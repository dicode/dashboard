dashboard
=========

This is a simple dashboard-skeleton, which allows the submission of
events into a rotating buffer.  New events push out old ones, and
we cap the events to the the most recent 1000.

The server accepts events via UDP, and logs them in Redis.

Submission is handled via [node.js](http://nodejs.org), and storage is handled
by [Redis](http://redis.io/).

This server was discussed in the article [Building a simple dashboard with redis and node.js ](http://www.debian-administration.org/article/682).



Installation
------------

Assuming you have `node.js` and `redis` installed then you may launch
the server by running:

     nodejs ./dashboard.js

This will result in a process accepting UDP submissions on port 4433.



Submitting Events
-----------------

Submitting events is as simple as firing UDP packets at the server which
is now running.

> **NOTE**:  The server will bind on all available interfaces, so you should firewall submissions from malicious hosts.

There is a sample perl-client included to submit events to the `dashboard.js` server
running on the localhost.

    perl submit.pl "This is a test"
    perl submit.pl "I like cake."


Viewing Events
--------------

There is a simple CGI script supplied which would make a good
starting point for a more dynamic event-viewer.  It could be invoked
via jQuery as-is, but probably needs more work.
